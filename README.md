# 3D-Suspension-System-Design

# This is not my specialty, but I wanted to learn Mechanical Engineering and design 3D design

# Adding wheels for traversing and mobility and a suspension system for the robot designed by Cinma 4D consisting of a wheel and a spring suspension mechanism that goes under each leg

# The wheel is designed with the required dimensions
